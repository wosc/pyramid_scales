The excellent `scales`_ library to collect in-process metrics (see Coda Haleâ€™s
CodeConf talk "`Metrics everywhere`_" among many others for reasons why you
might want use it) comes with a `flask`_-based HTTP server that allows viewing
the collected measurements and dumping them as JSON. But if you already are in
a web application using `pyramid`_, there's no real need to spin up yet another
thread, open another port etc. to do this.

Instead, you can simply include ``pyramid_scales`` like so::

    import pyramid.config
    config = pyramid.config.Configurator()
    # rest of your configuration goes here
    config.include('pyramid_scales')

This registeres a view below the URL ``/scales/`` where you can view your
application's metrics. If you need more control, register the
``pyramid_scales.scales_stats`` view yourself in whichever way you need.

This package is compatible with Python version 2.7 (scales itself does not
support Python3 yet, so there's no point here).
